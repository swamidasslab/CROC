Description
-----------

This pure-python package is designed to be a standardized implementation of performance curves
and metrics for use either in python scripts or through a simple commandline interface. As a standardized implementation
its output is robust enough to be using in publishable scientific work.

With this package, one can easily:

#. Compute the coordinates of both Accumulation Curves and ROC curves.
#. Handle ties appropriately using several methods.
#. Compute the BEDROC metric.
#. Vertically add and average the performance curves of several cross-validation folds.
#. Focus on the early part of the ROC curve by using several x-axis transforms.

The docstrings in this module are fairly complete and the scripts provide simple access to
the most common functions. Further documentation can be found at http://swami.wustl.edu/CROC/
