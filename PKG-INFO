        Description
        -----------
        
        This pure-python package is designed to be a standardized implementation of performance curves
        and metrics for use either in python scripts or through a simple commandline interface. As a standardized implementation
        its output is robust enough to be using in publishable scientific work.
        
        With this package, one can easily:
        
        #. Compute the coordinates of both Accumulation Curves and ROC curves.
        #. Handle ties appropriately using several methods.
        #. Compute the BEDROC metric.
        #. Vertically add and average the performance curves of several cross-validation folds.
        #. Focus on the early part of the ROC curve by using several x-axis transforms.
        
        The docstrings in this module are fairly complete and the scripts provide simple access to
        the most common functions. Further documentation can be found at http://swami.wustl.edu/CROC/
