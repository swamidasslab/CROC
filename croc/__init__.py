        Here are some examples of how this code will add curves, you may want to plot them out.

        >>> C1 = Curve([(0,0),(1,1)])
        >>> C2 = Curve([(0,0), (0,0.5), (1,0.5), (1,1)])
        >>> C3 = Curve([(0,0), (0.5,0), (0.5,1), (1,1)])

        >>> C1 + C2
        Curve([(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.5), (1.0, 1.5), (1.0, 2.0)])
        >>> C1 + C3
        Curve([(0.0, 0.0), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (1.0, 2.0)])
        >>> C2 + C3
        Curve([(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (1.0, 1.5), (1.0, 2.0)])

        And remember that adding a curve to itself is like vertically scaling it by 2.

        >>> (C1 + C1) == C1.vertical_scale(2)
        1
        >>> (C2 + C2) == C2.vertical_scale(2)
        1
        >>> (C3 + C3) == C3.vertical_scale(2)
        1

        Of course, addition is commutative:

        >>> (C2 + C1) == (C1 + C2) 
        1
        >>> (C1 + C3) == (C3 + C1)
        1
        >>> (C2 + C3) == (C3 + C2)
        1

        And adding two curves with area = 0.5 will result in a curve with area = 1.0.

        >>> (C2 + C1).area()
        1.0
        >>> (C1 + C3).area()
        1.0
        >>> (C2 + C3).area()
